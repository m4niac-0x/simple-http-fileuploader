# simple-http-fileuploader

This program is a very simple and stupid file uploader in golang. It deploy a minimalist HMTL page with a form to upload a file. The file is uploaded to the server in the same directory of the program. The program listen on port 11337.

It is useful for upload a file in a server over HTTP without authentication (like SSH or FTP). 

It's just a crappy tool, don't use it in production... please...
